Abstract:
Objectives: Psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) may arise from genetic and environmental risk leading to worsening cognitive and neural metrics over time, which in turn lead to worsening PLEs. Persistence and distress are factors that distinguish more clinically significant PLEs. Analyses used three waves of unique longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study data (ages 9-13) to test whether changes in cognition and structural neural metrics mediate associations of genetic and environmental risk with persistent distressing PLEs.

Methods:  Multigroup univariate latent growth models examined three waves of cognitive metrics and global structural neural metrics separately for three PLE groups: persistent distressing PLEs (n=356), transient distressing PLEs (n=408), and low-level PLEs (n=7901). Models then examined whether changes in cognitive and structural neural metrics over time indirectly linked associations between genetic liability (i.e., relevant polygenic risk scores) or environmental risk scores (e.g., poverty) and PLE groups.

Results: Persistent distressing PLEs showed greater decreases (i.e., more negative slopes) of cognition and cortical thickness over time compared to those in low-level PLE groups. Associations between genetic (i.e., lower educational attainment polygenic score) and environmental risk and persistent distressing PLEs were indirectly linked by lowered scores over time on several cognitive metrics (i.e., reading, picture vocabulary), with pattern processing speed, cortical volume, area, and subcortical volume over time additionally indirectly linking environmental risk with persistent distressing PLEs.

Conclusions: Analyses provide novel evidence for extant theories that worsening cognition and global structural metrics may represent mechanisms linking genetic and environmental risk to persistent distressing PLEs.

Code For:
1. Latent Growth Curve Models : multi-group latent growth curve analyses examining trajectories of cognitive and neural metrics separately by PLE group (i.e., persistent distressing PLEs, transient distressing PLEs, low-level PLEs)
3. Latent Profile Analyses: data-driven models examining PLE profiles from baseline through four year follow-up. Analyses indicated that a model with two PLE profiles showed the best fit. These individual profiles were save and then used as the group factor in multi-level latent profile analyses.
